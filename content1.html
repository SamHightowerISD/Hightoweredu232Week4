        <h2>The Importance of Typography in Instructional Design</h2>
        <p>Typography plays a vital role in how learners engage with instructional content. The choice of font, font size, line spacing, and text alignment all impact readability and comprehension. Clear, readable fonts like sans-serif types are widely recommended for digital materials because they reduce eye strain. Keeping font choices consistent across a design maintains visual harmony and prevents distractions. For example, using too many different fonts can make the content seem disorganized. However, using bold or italicized text sparingly can help emphasize key points without overwhelming the learner. Proper line spacing also ensures that text is not too cluttered, making it easier for the learner to follow along. Accessibility is another important considerationâ€”typography choices should support learners with visual impairments by offering sufficient contrast and larger font options. Ultimately, the careful use of typography can enhance the clarity, consistency, and overall effectiveness of the learning experience.</p>
