        <h2>The Importance of Typography in Instructional Design</h2>
        <p>Typography plays a vital role in how learners engage with instructional content. The choice of font, font size, line spacing, and text alignment all impact readability and comprehension. For example, sans-serif fonts like Arial and Helvetica are often preferred for online reading, as they offer better clarity on digital screens.</p>
        <p>It's important to maintain consistency in typography throughout an instructional design project to ensure that learners are not distracted by changes in font or style. Additionally, using the right amount of white space between lines and paragraphs can significantly improve readability.</p>
        <p>An excellent example of how typography can impact design is explored by Ina Saltz, a renowned expert in the field. You can view some of her educational content on typography <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=ina%20saltz">here</a>, where she discusses the importance of choosing the right font and layout for various purposes.</p>
