<h2>Color Contrast in Instructional Design</h2>
<p>Color contrast is essential in instructional design to enhance visibility and accessibility. Strong contrast between background and text makes it easier for learners to read and absorb information. Poor contrast, such as light gray text on a white background, can strain the eyes and reduce comprehension. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text, which ensures that content is legible for individuals with visual impairments or color blindness. Proper color contrast improves focus and allows learners to engage with materials without unnecessary frustration. When designing, itâ€™s important to test color combinations to make sure they work well across different platforms and for diverse audiences. This helps create inclusive instructional materials accessible to all learners.</p>
