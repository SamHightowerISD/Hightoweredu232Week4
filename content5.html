        <h2>The Importance of Consistency in Instructional Design</h2>
        <p>Consistency is a key principle in instructional design, as it directly impacts how easily learners can engage with and understand the material. By maintaining a uniform design across all instructional elements—such as fonts, colors, and navigation—learners can focus on the content without being distracted by unnecessary variations.</p>
        <p>However, subtle variations, such as slight changes in color or layout, can sometimes help maintain attention and reduce monotony. For example, consistent use of navigation buttons like play symbols across various platforms helps learners quickly recognize and interact with content.</p>
