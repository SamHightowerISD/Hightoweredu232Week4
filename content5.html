        <h2>The Importance of Consistency in Instructional Design</h2>
        <p>Consistency is one of the fundamental principles of effective instructional design. Maintaining consistency across all aspects of the course—such as font types, colors, headings, and layouts—helps create a sense of familiarity for learners. This allows them to focus more on the content itself rather than navigating varying formats or styles. Consistent design reduces the cognitive load on learners and ensures a smoother learning experience. However, consistency does not mean everything must be rigid; small deviations can be used strategically to highlight important information or sections. For example, the universally recognized play button icon is consistent across different platforms, making it easy for users to recognize its function without explanation. This type of design consistency ensures that learners can engage with instructional content intuitively and without confusion.</p>
