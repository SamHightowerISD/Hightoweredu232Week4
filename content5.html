<h2>Consistency in Instructional Design</h2>
<p>Consistency is a key principle in instructional design, and it directly impacts how easily learners can engage with and understand the material. By maintaining a uniform design throughout a course—using the same fonts, colors, layouts, and terminology—learners are less likely to experience confusion. Consistency provides a sense of stability, which allows learners to focus on the content rather than adjusting to different design patterns. However, slight instances of inconsistency, like introducing a novel design element, can sometimes stimulate interest and prevent boredom. For example, when users see the same 'play' icon across different media platforms, they instantly recognize its function. But changing the icon in a unique way could grab the learner's attention and highlight a special feature or interactive tool.</p>
