        <h2>The Importance of Alignment in Instructional Design</h2>
        <p>Alignment is a fundamental principle in both visual design and instructional design. In visual design, alignment refers to how text and visual elements are arranged relative to each other. Proper alignment improves the readability and structure of the content, making it easier for learners to engage with and process the information. It also creates a cleaner, more professional look.</p>
        <p>In instructional design, alignment is not limited to the layout of visual elements. It also refers to ensuring that learning objectives, activities, and assessments are aligned with the instructional goals. This ensures a cohesive learning experience where each element of the design reinforces the intended learning outcomes.</p>
