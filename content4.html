<h2>Alignment in Instructional Design</h2>
<p>Alignment in instructional design ensures that content is organized, visually coherent, and easy to navigate. Proper alignment helps learners understand the relationships between different pieces of content, whether it be text, images, or interactive elements. Left-aligned text is usually the standard for most instructional materials as it’s easier to read, especially for large blocks of text. On the other hand, center-aligned or justified text may cause uneven spacing between words, leading to a phenomenon called the “river of white” effect, where large gaps run through the text, disrupting readability. For example, as seen in the image below, justified text can create large white spaces that make reading difficult, particularly on smaller screens. Ensuring proper alignment not only makes the content aesthetically pleasing but also improves the overall user experience.</p>
