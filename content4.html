        <h2>The Importance of Alignment in Instructional Design</h2>
        <p>Alignment plays a key role in creating a structured and organized layout, which improves the clarity and flow of instructional materials. When elements on a page are properly aligned, it creates a visual connection between them, allowing learners to easily follow the content. Left-aligned text is generally considered easier to read, particularly for longer sections of content. In contrast, fully justified text can lead to uneven spaces between words, known as "rivers of white," which can distract readers and reduce readability. Proper alignment ensures that both text and images are placed in a way that guides the learnerâ€™s eye naturally across the page. Inconsistent or poor alignment can create confusion, making it harder for learners to focus on the key information. Therefore, maintaining consistent alignment throughout instructional materials helps create a clean and professional appearance that supports the learning experience.</p>
