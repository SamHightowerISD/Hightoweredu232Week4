<h2>White Space in Instructional Design</h2>
<p>White space, or negative space, refers to the empty areas around text, images, and other elements in a design. While it may seem like wasted space, it is essential in instructional design for improving readability and reducing cognitive load. White space allows learners to focus on the content without feeling overwhelmed by too much information on the screen. It helps to separate distinct elements, making the layout cleaner and more organized. Using white space effectively can guide the learnerâ€™s eyes from one section to another, creating a natural flow through the material. Furthermore, studies show that white space can increase comprehension by up to 20% (Lin, 2016). Therefore, leveraging white space strategically in instructional materials enhances both the visual appeal and effectiveness of the content.</p>
